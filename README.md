### FAQ.API - Project Overview
  * Welcome to the FAQ Web API repository! This project is (Frequently Asked Questions) system built using .NET 7 and SQL Server. It   
    provides a RESTful API interface for managing and retrieving frequently asked questions and their corresponding answers.

### Key Features:
  * Flexible API Endpoints: The API offers a range of endpoints to create, update, delete.
  * Structured Data Storage: The FAQ data is stored in a SQL Server database, ensuring scalability, reliability, and easy maintenance.
  * CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): The API includes CORS support, allowing client applications to access the API from different domains.
  * Dependency Injection: The project utilizes the built-in dependency injection feature of .NET, facilitating the management and injection of dependencies.
  * AutoMapper: The API integrates AutoMapper, simplifying the mapping between different data models within the application.
  * API Rate Limiting: The API incorporates rate-limiting functionality to control the number of requests a client can make within a specified time period.
  * Custom API Authorization: Custom API authorization mechanisms are implemented to secure the endpoints and restrict access to authorized users only. This 
    ensures that only authenticated and authorized clients can interact with the API.
  * Secure Authentication: You can implement secure authentication mechanisms, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens), to control access to the API endpoints and protect 
    sensitive data.
